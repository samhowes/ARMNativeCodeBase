Notes:
 - By adding the unity subview to ARMViewController in ARMAppController:createViewHierarchyImpl, I don't have to have Test/ARMViewcontroller classes, and can just have one production class.

 R Integrate Networking/Create a networking implementation
 R Integrate New unity code ??
 - Separate the settings screen into three individual views
 - Do the artwork for the App Icon and loading screens
 - Add user hints about configuration

Bugs:
